# Introduction

<div class="alert alert-info">
  <strong>Note:</strong> Murphy:Ch01 covers most of the in this chapter material really well (and with much more supporting material and examples), although some definitions are slightly different. Wasserman:Ch06 is a very nice complementary reference for definition of model, parametric and nonparametric.

Uncertainty - a lack of complete information about something - can be the result of many things. In the context of Probability and Statistics courses uncertainty is often synonymous with the randomness of the studied phenomena. However, that need not always be the case. Incomplete information could also be due to lack of knowledge, ignorance, or just plain laziness.

Whatever the reason might be for our uncertainty, quantitative reasoning
with uncertainty requires us to give a complete and precise description of the studied phenomena and the uncertainty. Informally, the minimal amount of structure we need is

(i)  a description of all possible truths',

(ii) a set of all events - subsets of possible truths that we allow
ourselves to assign uncertainty to, and 

(iii) an assignment of uncertainty to each event.

The formalism we will use throughout the course is a probability space - a triplet that formalizes what can informally be stated as

## Learning outcomes

Data science students should work towards obtaining the knowledge and the skills that enable them to:

* Classify real world problems into subtasks of machine learning.
* Distinguish between parametric and nonparametric models and describe their characteristics.
* Recognize which set of solutions (which hypothesis) we restrict ourselves to by selecting a particular model.
* Identify which aspects of model utility (error, interpretability, computation speed) are more important for the problem at hand.
* Describe the concepts *curse of dimensionality* and *no free lunch* and their implications for practical work.
