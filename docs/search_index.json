At the end of the chapter, we look more closely at discrete probability spaces. The students are expected to acquire the following knowledge: Theoretical Use properties of probability to calculate probabilities. Combinatorics. Understanding of continuity of probability. R vectors for loop estimating probability with simulation sample function matrices 1.1 Measure and probability spaces Exercise 1.1 (Completing a set to a Sigma algebra) Let \\(\\Omega = \\{1,2,...,10\\}\\). Let \\(A = [\\{ \\}, \\{1\\}, \\{2\\}, \\Omega]\\). Show that \\(A\\) is not a sigma algebra of \\(\\Omega\\). Find the minimum number of elements to complete A to a sigma algebra of \\(\\Omega\\). Solution. \\(1^c = \\{2,3,...,10\\} \\notin A \\implies\\) \\(A\\) is not sigma algebra. First we need the complements of all elements, so we need to add sets \\(\\{2,3,...,10\\}\\) and \\(\\{1,3,4,...,10\\}\\). Next we need unions of all sets – we add the set \\(\\{1,2\\}\\). Again we need the complement of this set, so we add \\(\\{3,4,...,10\\}\\). So the minimum number of elements we need to add is 4. Exercise 1.2 (Diversity of sigma algebras) Let \\(\\Omega\\) be a set. Show that \\(2^{\\Omega}\\) is a sigma algebra. Find the smallest sigma algebra of \\(\\Omega\\). Find the largest Sigma algebra of \\(\\Omega\\). Solution. TODO \\(A = \\{\\emptyset, \\Omega\\}\\) \\(2^{\\Omega}\\) Exercise 1.3 Find all sigma algebras for \\(\\Omega = \\{0, 1, 2\\}\\). Solution. \\(A = \\{\\emptyset, \\Omega\\}\\) \\(A = 2^{\\Omega}\\) \\(A = \\{\\emptyset, \\{0\\}, \\{1,2\\}, \\Omega\\}\\) \\(A = \\{\\emptyset, \\{1\\}, \\{0,2\\}, \\Omega\\}\\) \\(A = \\{\\emptyset, \\{2\\}, \\{0,1\\}, \\Omega\\}\\) Exercise 1.4 (Difference between algebra and sigma algebra) TODO Solution. TODO Exercise 1.5 (Intro to measure) Take the measurable space \\(\\Omega = \\{1,2\\}\\), \\(F = 2^{\\Omega}\\). Which of the following is a measure? Which is a probability measure? \\(\\mu(\\emptyset) = 0\\), \\(\\mu(\\{1\\}) = 5\\), \\(\\mu(\\{2\\}) = 6\\), \\(\\mu(\\{1,2\\}) = 11\\) \\(\\mu(\\emptyset) = 0\\), \\(\\mu(\\{1\\}) = 0\\), \\(\\mu(\\{2\\}) = 0\\), \\(\\mu(\\{1,2\\}) = 1\\) \\(\\mu(\\emptyset) = 0\\), \\(\\mu(\\{1\\}) = 0\\), \\(\\mu(\\{2\\}) = 0\\), \\(\\mu(\\{1,2\\}) = 0\\) \\(\\mu(\\emptyset) = 0\\), \\(\\mu(\\{1\\}) = 0\\), \\(\\mu(\\{2\\}) = 1\\), \\(\\mu(\\{1,2\\}) = 1\\) \\(\\mu(\\emptyset)=0\\), \\(\\mu(\\{1\\})=0\\), \\(\\mu(\\{2\\})=\\infty\\), \\(\\mu(\\{1,2\\})=\\infty\\) Solution. Measure. Not probability measure since \\(\\mu(\\Omega) &gt; 1\\). Neither due to countable additivity. Measure. Not probability measure since \\(\\mu(\\Omega) = 0\\). Probability measure. Measure. Not probability measure since \\(\\mu(\\Omega) &gt; 1\\). Exercise 1.6 Define a probability space that could be used to model a fair 6-sided die. Solution. \\(\\Omega = \\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}\\) \\(F = 2^{\\Omega}\\) \\(\\forall \\omega \\in \\Omega\\), \\(P(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{6}\\) 1.2 Properties of probability measures Exercise 1.7 A standard deck (52 cards) is distributed to two persons: 26 cards to each person. All partitions are equally likely. Find the probability that: The first person gets 4 Queens. The first person gets at least 2 Queens. # - The first person gets at least 2 Queens and at least 2 Kings. R: Use simulation (sample) to check the above answers. Solution. \\(\\frac{{48}\\choose{22}}{{52}\\choose{26}}\\) \\(1 - \\frac{{48}\\choose{26}}{{52}\\choose{26}} - 4 \\frac{{48}\\choose{25}}{{52}\\choose{26}}\\) For the simulation, let us represent cards with numbers from 1 to 52, and let 1 through 4 represent Queens, and 5 through 8 represent Kings. set.seed(1) cards &lt;- 1:52 n &lt;- 10000 q4 &lt;- vector(mode = &quot;logical&quot;, length = n) q2 &lt;- vector(mode = &quot;logical&quot;, length = n) for (i in 1:n) { p1 &lt;- sample(1:52, 26) q4[i] &lt;- sum(1:4 %in% p1) == 4 q2[i] &lt;- sum(1:4 %in% p1) &gt;= 2 } sum(q4) / n ## [1] 0.0556 sum(q2) / n ## [1] 0.6995 Exercise 1.8 Let \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) be events with probabilities \\(P(A) = \\frac{5}{6}\\) and \\(P(B) = \\frac{1}{4}\\). Show that \\(\\frac{1}{12} \\leq P(A\\cap B) \\leq \\frac{1}{4}\\), and give examples to show that both extremes are possible. Find corresponding bounds for \\(P(A\\cup B)\\). R: Draw samples from the examples and estimate the probability of \\(P(A\\cap B)\\). Solution. Smth From the properties of probability we have \\[\\begin{equation} P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\cap B) \\leq 1. \\end{equation}\\] From this follows \\[\\begin{align} P(A \\cap B) \\geq P(A) + P(B) - 1 = \\frac{5}{6} + \\frac{1}{4} - 1 = \\frac{1}{12}. \\end{align}\\] On the other hand \\[\\begin{equation} P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\cap B) \\geq 0. \\end{equation}\\] The maximum probability of the union can be 1, for example if we take a 12-sided dice, and \\(A\\) corresponds to throwing 1 through 10 and \\(B\\) corresponds to throwing 9 through 12. So \\[\\begin{equation} P(A \\cap B) = \\frac{5}{6} + \\frac{1}{4} - 1 = \\frac{1}{12}. \\end{equation}\\] Therefore, the lower bound for the probability of intersection is \\(\\frac{1}{12}\\). Conversely, the minimum probability of union can be \\(\\frac{5}{6}\\), so \\[\\begin{equation} P(A \\cap B) = \\frac{5}{6} + \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{5}{6} = \\frac{1}{4}. \\end{equation}\\] Therefore, the upper bound for the probability of intersection is \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\). We use the … We use sample in R: a &lt;- sample(1000, 1:6, replace = TRUE) mean(a) ## [1] 437 Exercise 1.9 Something with Poisson. This is 1.9. "]
