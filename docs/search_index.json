The students are expected to acquire the following knowledge: Theoretical Calculation of the expected value. Calculation of variance and covariance. Cauchy distribution. R Estimation of expected value. Estimation of variance and covariance. 7.1 Discrete random variables Exercise 7.1 (Bernoulli) Let \\(X \\sim \\text{Bernoulli}(p)\\). Find \\(E[X]\\). Find \\(Var[X]\\). R: Let \\(p = 0.4\\). Check your answers to a) and b) with a simulation. Exercise 7.2 (Binomial) Let \\(X \\sim \\text{Binomial}(n,p)\\). Find \\(E[X]\\). Find \\(Var[X]\\). Exercise 7.3 (Poisson) Let \\(X \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda)\\). Find \\(E[X]\\). Find \\(Var[X]\\). Exercise 7.4 (Geometric) Let \\(X \\sim \\text{Geometric}(p)\\). Find \\(E[X]\\). Hint: \\(\\frac{d}{dx} x^k = k x^{(k - 1)}\\). 7.2 Continuous random variables Exercise 7.5 (Gamma) Let \\(X \\sim \\text{Gamma}(\\alpha, \\beta)\\). Hint: \\(\\Gamma(z) = \\int_0^\\infty t^{z-1}e^{-t} dt\\) and \\(\\Gamma(z + 1) = z \\Gamma(z)\\). Find \\(E[X]\\). Find \\(Var[X]\\). R: Let \\(\\alpha = 10\\) and \\(\\beta = 2\\). Plot the density of \\(X\\). Add a horizontal line at the expected value that touches the density curve (geom_segment). Shade the area within a standard deviation of the expected value. Exercise 7.6 (Beta) Let \\(X \\sim \\text{Beta}(\\alpha, \\beta)\\). Find \\(E[X]\\). Hint 1: \\(\\text{B}(x,y) = \\int_0^1 t^{x-1} (1 - t)^{y-1} dt\\). Hint 2: \\(\\text{B}(x + 1, y) = \\text{B}(x,y)\\frac{x}{x + y}\\). Find \\(Var[X]\\). Exercise 7.7 (Exponential) Let \\(X \\sim \\text{Exp}(\\lambda)\\). Find \\(E[X]\\). Hint: \\(\\Gamma(z + 1) = z\\Gamma(z)\\) and \\(\\Gamma(1) = 1\\). Find \\(Var[X]\\). Exercise 7.8 (Normal) Let \\(X \\sim \\text{N}(\\mu, \\sigma)\\). Show that \\(E[X] = \\mu\\). Hint: Use the error function \\(\\text{erf}(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt(\\pi)} \\int_{-x}^x e^{-t^2} dt\\). The statistical interpretation of this function is that if \\(Y \\sim \\text{N}(0, 0.5)\\), then the error function describes the probability of \\(Y\\) falling between \\(-x\\) and \\(x\\). Show that \\(Var[X] = \\sigma^2\\). Hint: Start with the definition of variance. 7.3 Sums, functions, conditional expectations Exercise 7.9 (Expectation of transformations) Let \\(X\\) follow a normal distribution. Find \\(E[2X + 4]\\). Find \\(E[X^2]\\). Find \\(E[\\exp(X)]\\). R: Check your results numerically for \\(\\mu = 0.4\\) and \\(\\sigma^2 = 0.25\\) and plot the densities of all four distributions. Exercise 7.10 (Sum of independent random variables) WASSERMAN. Let \\(X_1, X_2,...,X_n\\) be IID random variables with expected value \\(E[X_i] = \\mu\\) and variance \\(Var[X_i] = \\sigma^2\\). Find the expected value and variance of \\(\\bar{X} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n X_i\\). \\(\\bar{X}\\) is called a statistic (a function of the values in a sample). It is itself a random variable and its distribution is called a sampling distribution. R: Take \\(n = 5, 10, 100, 1000\\) samples from the N(\\(2\\), \\(6\\)) distribution 10000 times. Plot the theoretical density and the densities of \\(\\bar{X}\\) statistic for each \\(n\\). Intuitively, are the results in correspondence with your calculations? Check them numerically. Exercise 7.11 (Conditional expectation) Let \\(X \\in \\mathbb{R}_0^+\\) and \\(Y \\in \\mathbb{N}_0\\) be random variables with joint distribution \\(p_{XY}(X,Y) = \\frac{1}{y + 1} e^{-\\frac{x}{y + 1}} 0.5^{y + 1}\\). Find \\(E[X | Y]\\) by first finding \\(p_Y\\) and then \\(p_{X|Y}\\). Find \\(E[X]\\). R: check your answers to a) and b) by drawing 10000 samples from \\(p_Y\\) and \\(p_{X|Y}\\). Exercise 7.12 (Cauchy distribution) Let \\(p(x | x_0, \\gamma) = \\frac{1}{\\pi \\gamma \\Big(1 + \\big(\\frac{x - x_0}{\\gamma}\\big)^2\\Big)}\\). A random variable with this PDF follows a Cauchy distribution. This distribution is symmetric and has wider tails than the normal distribution. R: Draw \\(n = 1,...,1000\\) samples from a standard normal and \\(\\text{Cauchy}(0, 1)\\). For each \\(n\\) plot the mean and the median of the sample using facets. Interpret the results. To get a mathematical explanation of the results in a), evaluate the integral \\(\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{x}{1 + x^2} dx\\) and consider that \\(E[X] = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\frac{x}{1 + x^2}dx\\). 7.4 Covariance Exercise 7.13 Below is a table of values for random variables \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). X Y 2.1 8 -0.5 11 1 10 -2 12 4 9 Find sample covariance of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). Find sample variances of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). Find sample correlation of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). Find sample variance of \\(Z = 2X - 3Y\\). Exercise 7.14 Let \\(X \\sim \\text{Uniform}(0,1)\\) and \\(Y | X = x \\sim \\text{Uniform(0,x)}\\). Find the covariance of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). Find the correlation of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). R: check your answers to a) and b) with simulation. Plot \\(X\\) against \\(Y\\) on a scatterplot. "]
