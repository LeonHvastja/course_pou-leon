Matrices and matrix operations. 1.1 Measure and probability spaces Exercise 1.1 (Completing a set to a sigma algebra) Let \\(\\Omega = \\{1,2,...,10\\}\\) and let \\(A = \\{\\emptyset, \\{1\\}, \\{2\\}, \\Omega \\}\\). Show that \\(A\\) is not a sigma algebra of \\(\\Omega\\). Find the minimum number of elements to complete A to a sigma algebra of \\(\\Omega\\). Solution. \\(1^c = \\{2,3,...,10\\} \\notin A \\implies\\) \\(A\\) is not sigma algebra. First we need the complements of all elements, so we need to add sets \\(\\{2,3,...,10\\}\\) and \\(\\{1,3,4,...,10\\}\\). Next we need unions of all sets – we add the set \\(\\{1,2\\}\\). Again we need the complement of this set, so we add \\(\\{3,4,...,10\\}\\). So the minimum number of elements we need to add is 4. Exercise 1.2 (Diversity of sigma algebras) Let \\(\\Omega\\) be a set. Show that \\(2^{\\Omega}\\) is a sigma algebra. Find the smallest sigma algebra of \\(\\Omega\\). Find the largest sigma algebra of \\(\\Omega\\). Exercise 1.3 Find all sigma algebras for \\(\\Omega = \\{0, 1, 2\\}\\). Exercise 1.4 (Difference between algebra and sigma algebra) Let \\(\\Omega = \\mathbb{N}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{A} = \\{A \\subseteq \\mathbb{N}: A \\text{ is finite or } A^c \\text{ is finite.} \\}\\). Show that \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) is an algebra but not a sigma algebra. Exercise 1.5 (Intro to measure) Take the measurable space \\(\\Omega = \\{1,2\\}\\), \\(F = 2^{\\Omega}\\). Which of the following is a measure? Which is a probability measure? \\(\\mu(\\emptyset) = 0\\), \\(\\mu(\\{1\\}) = 5\\), \\(\\mu(\\{2\\}) = 6\\), \\(\\mu(\\{1,2\\}) = 11\\) \\(\\mu(\\emptyset) = 0\\), \\(\\mu(\\{1\\}) = 0\\), \\(\\mu(\\{2\\}) = 0\\), \\(\\mu(\\{1,2\\}) = 1\\) \\(\\mu(\\emptyset) = 0\\), \\(\\mu(\\{1\\}) = 0\\), \\(\\mu(\\{2\\}) = 0\\), \\(\\mu(\\{1,2\\}) = 0\\) \\(\\mu(\\emptyset) = 0\\), \\(\\mu(\\{1\\}) = 0\\), \\(\\mu(\\{2\\}) = 1\\), \\(\\mu(\\{1,2\\}) = 1\\) \\(\\mu(\\emptyset)=0\\), \\(\\mu(\\{1\\})=0\\), \\(\\mu(\\{2\\})=\\infty\\), \\(\\mu(\\{1,2\\})=\\infty\\) Solution. Measure. Not probability measure since \\(\\mu(\\Omega) &gt; 1\\). Neither due to countable additivity. Measure. Not probability measure since \\(\\mu(\\Omega) = 0\\). Probability measure. Measure. Not probability measure since \\(\\mu(\\Omega) &gt; 1\\). Exercise 1.6 Define a probability space that could be used to model the outcome of throwing two fair 6-sided dice. 1.2 Properties of probability measures Exercise 1.7 A standard deck (52 cards) is distributed to two persons: 26 cards to each person. All partitions are equally likely. Find the probability that: The first person gets 4 Queens. The first person gets at least 2 Queens. The first person gets at least 2 Queens and at least 2 Kings. R: Use simulation (sample) to check the above answers. Exercise 1.8 Let \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) be events with probabilities \\(P(A) = \\frac{2}{3}\\) and \\(P(B) = \\frac{1}{2}\\). Show that \\(\\frac{1}{6} \\leq P(A\\cap B) \\leq \\frac{1}{2}\\), and give examples to show that both extremes are possible. Find corresponding bounds for \\(P(A\\cup B)\\). R: Draw samples from the examples and show the probability bounds of \\(P(A \\cap B)\\) . Exercise 1.9 A fair coin is tossed repeatedly. Show that, with probability one, a head turns up sooner or later. Show similarly that any given finite sequence of heads and tails occurs eventually with probability one. Solution. \\[\\begin{align} P(\\text{no heads}) &amp;= \\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} P(\\text{no heads in first }n \\text{ tosses}) \\\\ &amp;= \\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{1}{2^n} \\\\ &amp;= 0. \\end{align}\\] For the second part, let us fix the given sequence of heads and tails of length \\(k\\) as \\(s\\). A probability that this happens in \\(k\\) tosses is \\(\\frac{1}{2^k}\\). \\[\\begin{align} P(s \\text{ occurs}) &amp;= \\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} P(s \\text{ occurs in first } nk \\text{ tosses}) \\end{align}\\] The right part of the upper equation is greater than if \\(s\\) occurs either in the first \\(k\\) tosses, second \\(k\\) tosses,…, \\(n\\)-th \\(k\\) tosses. Therefore \\[\\begin{align} P(s \\text{ occurs}) &amp;\\geq \\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} P(s \\text{ occurs in first } n \\text{ disjoint sequences of length } k) \\\\ &amp;= \\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} (1 - P(s \\text{ does not occur in first } n \\text{ disjoint sequences})) \\\\ &amp;= 1 - \\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} P(s \\text{ does not occur in first } n \\text{ disjoint sequences}) \\\\ &amp;= 1 - \\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} (1 - \\frac{1}{2^k})^n \\\\ &amp;= 1. \\end{align}\\] Exercise 1.10 An Erdos-Renyi random graph \\(G(n,p)\\) is a model with \\(n\\) nodes, where each pair of nodes is connected with probability \\(p\\). Calculate the probability that there exists a node that is not connected to any other node in \\(G(4,0.6)\\). Show that the upper bound for the probability that there exist 2 nodes that are not connected to any other node for an arbitrary \\(G(n,p)\\) is \\(\\binom{n}{2} (1-p)^{2n - 3}\\). R: Estimate the probability from the first point using simulation. 1.3 Discrete probability spaces Exercise 1.11 Show that the standard measurable space on \\(\\Omega = \\{0,1,...,n\\}\\) equipped with binomial measure is a discrete probability space. Define another probability measure on this measurable space. Show that for \\(n=1\\) the binomial measure is the same as the Bernoulli measure. R: Draw 1000 samples from the binomial distribution \\(p=0.5\\), \\(n=20\\) (rbinom) and compare relative frequencies with theoretical probability measure. Solution. We need to show that the terms of \\(\\sum_{k=0}^n \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1 - p)^{n - k}\\) sum to 1. For that we use the binomial theorem \\(\\sum_{k=0}^n \\binom{n}{k} x^k y^{n-k} = (x + y)^n\\). So \\[\\begin{equation} \\sum_{k=0}^n \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1 - p)^{n - k} = (p + 1 - p)^n = 1. \\end{equation}\\] \\(P(\\{k\\}) = \\frac{1}{n + 1}\\). When \\(n=1\\) then \\(k \\in \\{0,1\\}\\). Inserting \\(n=1\\) into the binomial measure, we get \\(\\binom{1}{k}p^k (1-p)^{1 - k}\\). Now \\(\\binom{1}{1} = \\binom{1}{0} = 1\\), so the measure is \\(p^k (1-p)^{1 - k}\\), which is the Bernoulli measure. set.seed(1) library(ggplot2) library(dplyr) bin_samp &lt;- rbinom(n = 1000, size = 20, prob = 0.5) bin_samp &lt;- data.frame(x = bin_samp) %&gt;% count(x) %&gt;% mutate(n = n / 1000, type = &quot;empirical_frequencies&quot;) %&gt;% bind_rows(data.frame(x = 0:20, n = dbinom(0:20, size = 20, prob = 0.5), type = &quot;theoretical_measure&quot;)) bin_plot &lt;- ggplot(data = bin_samp, aes(x = x, y = n, fill = type)) + geom_bar(stat=&quot;identity&quot;, position = &quot;dodge&quot;) plot(bin_plot) Exercise 1.12 Show that the standard measurable space on \\(\\Omega = \\{0,1,...,\\infty\\}\\) equipped with geometric measure is a discrete probability space, equipped with Poisson measure is a discrete probability space. Define another probability measure on this measurable space. R: Draw 1000 samples from the Poisson distribution \\(\\lambda = 10\\) (rpois) and compare relative frequencies with theoretical probability measure. Exercise 1.13 Define a probability measure on \\((\\Omega = \\mathbb{Z}, 2^{\\mathbb{Z}})\\). Define a probability measure such that \\(P(\\omega) &gt; 0, \\forall \\omega \\in \\Omega\\). R: Implement a random generator that will generate samples with the relative frequency that corresponds to your probability measure. Compare relative frequencies with theoretical probability measure . Exercise 1.14 Define a probability measure on \\(\\Omega = \\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}\\) with parameter \\(m \\in \\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}\\), so that the probability of outcome at distance \\(1\\) from \\(m\\) is half of the probability at distance \\(0\\), at distance \\(2\\) is half of the probability at distance \\(1\\), etc. R: Implement a random generator that will generate samples with the relative frequency that corresponds to your probability measure. Compare relative frequencies with theoretical probability measure . "]
