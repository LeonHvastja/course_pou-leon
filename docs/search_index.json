What turned out to be a successful approach was to estimate the maximum from the serial numbers of the small sample of captured or destroyed tanks (describe the statistical model used). What assumptions were made by using the above model? Do you think they are reasonable assumptions in practice? Show that the plug-in estimate for the maximum (i.e. the maximum of the sample) is a biased estimator. Derive the maximum likelihood estimate of the maximum. Check that the following estimator is not biased: \\(\\hat{n} = \\frac{k + 1}{k}m - 1\\). "]
