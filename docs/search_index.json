A.5.3 Dplyr and ggplot Dplyr can make your data manipulation (and therefore your life) a whole lot easier. Instead of several nested for loops or complex apply structures, dpylr can do useful data filtering, transformation, grouping, summarization,… in a matter of only a few lines. ggplot … A.6 Further reading and references Cheatsheets: https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/ Our literature on R, dplyr, ggplot2, and R Markdown workshop: https://github.com/bstatcomp/Rworkshop A.7 Learning outcomes A.8 Practice problems "]
