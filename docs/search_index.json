The students are expected to acquire the following knowledge: Theoretical Understand Borel sets and identify them Estimate Lebesgue measure for different sets. Know when sets are Borel-measurable. R uniform sampling mean recursion 2.1 Borel sets 2.2 Lebesgue measure Exercise 2.1 Show that the Lebesgue measure of rational numbers on \\([0,1]\\) is 0. R: Implement a random number generator, which generates uniform samples of irrational numbers in \\([0,1]\\) by uniformly sampling from \\([0,1]\\) and rejecting a sample if it is rational. Solution. There are a countable number of rational numbers. Therefore, we can write \\[\\begin{align} \\lambda(\\mathbb{Q}) &amp;= \\lambda(\\cup_{i = 1}^{\\infty} q_i) &amp;\\\\ &amp;= \\sum_{i = 1}^{\\infty} \\lambda(q_i) &amp;\\text{ (countable additivity)} \\\\ &amp;= \\sum_{i = 1}^{\\infty} 0 &amp;\\text{ (Lebesgue measure of a singleton)} \\\\ &amp;= 0. \\end{align}\\] Exercise 2.2 Show that \\(\\mathcal{C} = \\sigma(\\mathcal{C})\\) if and only if \\(\\mathcal{C}\\) is a sigma algebra. Solution. TODO Exercise 2.3 Prove that the Lebesgue measure of \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) is infinity. Paradox. Show that the cardinality of \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) and \\((0,1)\\) is the same, while their Lebesgue measures are infinity and one respectably. Solution. Let \\(a_i\\) be the \\(i\\)-th integer for \\(i \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\). We can write \\(\\mathbb{R} = \\cup_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} (a_i, a_{i + 1}]\\). \\[\\begin{align} \\lambda(\\mathbb{R}) &amp;= \\lambda(\\cup_{i = -\\infty}^{\\infty} (a_i, a_{i + 1}]) \\\\ &amp;= \\lambda(\\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\cup_{i = -n}^{n} (a_i, a_{i + 1}]) \\\\ &amp;= \\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\lambda(\\cup_{i = -n}^{n} (a_i, a_{i + 1}]) \\\\ &amp;= \\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\sum_{i = -n}^{n} \\lambda((a_i, a_{i + 1}]) \\\\ &amp;= \\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\sum_{i = -n}^{n} 1 \\\\ &amp;= \\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} 2n \\\\ &amp;= \\infty. \\end{align}\\] We need to find a bijection between \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) and \\((0,1)\\). A well-known function that maps from a bounded interval to \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) is the tangent. To make the bijection easier to achieve, we will take the inverse, which maps from \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) to \\((-\\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\frac{\\pi}{2})\\). However, we need to change the function so it maps to \\((0,1)\\). First we add \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\), so that we move the function above zero. Then we only have to divide by the max value, which in this case is \\(\\pi\\). So our bijection is \\[\\begin{equation} f(x) = \\frac{\\tan^{-1}(x) + \\frac{\\pi}{2}}{\\pi}. \\end{equation}\\] Exercise 2.4 Take the measure space \\((\\Omega_1 = (0,1], B_{(0,1], \\lambda})\\) (we know that this is a probability space on \\((0,1]\\)). Define an injective map (function) from \\(\\Omega_1\\) to \\(\\Omega_2 = \\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}\\) such that the measure space \\((\\Omega_2, 2^{\\Omega_2}, \\lambda(f^{-1}()))\\) will be a discrete probability space with uniform probabilities (\\(P(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{6}, \\forall \\omega \\in \\Omega_2)\\). Is the map that you defined in (a) the only such map? How would you in the same fashion define an injective map that would result in a probability space that can be interpreted as a coin toss with probability \\(p\\) of heads? R: Use the map in (a) as a basis for a random generator for this fair die. Solution. In other words, we have to assign disjunct intervals of the same size to each element of \\(\\Omega_2\\). Therefore \\[\\begin{equation} f(x) = \\lceil 6x \\rceil. \\end{equation}\\] No we could for example rearrange the order in which the intervals are mapped to integers. Additionally, we could have several disjoint intervals that mapped to the same integer, as long as the Lebesgue measure of their union would be \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\) and the function would remain injective. We have \\(\\Omega_3 = \\{0,1\\}\\), where zero represents heads and one represents tails. Then \\[\\begin{equation} f(x) = 0^{I_{A}(x)}, \\end{equation}\\] where \\(A = \\{y \\in (0,1] : y &lt; p\\}\\). set.seed(1) unif_s &lt;- runif(1000) die_s &lt;- ceiling(6 * unif_s) summary(as.factor(die_s)) ## 1 2 3 4 5 6 ## 166 154 200 146 166 168 "]
